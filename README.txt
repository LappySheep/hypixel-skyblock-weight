A 'weight calculator', designed to take specific stats and run calculations on them, resulting in a number as output.
This number is representative of the player's progress, and therefore should scale from various aspects;
  ; time taken
  ; value of the aspect - is it worth acquiring?
  ; proportionality and realism from gameplay - is it unrealistic to assume that a 'top' player would have this aspect? What about earlier players?

Overall, we can assign scores and ratings to aspects of gameplay, which can then be weighted to a finalised amount.

For now, only the skills/slayers/dungeons/collections aspects will be made public. Perhaps in future I will release the rest.

Originally, I decided to keep my formulas private, in the massive inferiority complex that I had created for myself.
After discussing with various people, I have changed that thought and thus this repository exists.

Since I use these calculations for my bot, if you have issues to raise, they will be used in my main Discord bot as well.



Senither has a tool to make collecting important player statistics easier (since the Hypixel API may be frustrating and/or less intuitive to use than expected):
